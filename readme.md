# CookUnity exercise

Hello, in this repo

## Considerations

In my opinion, I was an overkilling to use classes, interfaces, SOLID principles, etc. Anyway, I use some principles of clean code, such a test and single responsibility principle.
I did not use libraries. The test were made in native JS.

- Pay attention to positions instead of letters, you can transform using the method ```positionToChar(position)```
- The method ```shouldAddValue``` is who has the rules. If the requirements change in the future, you only have to chage this method.
- If you need more information, you can read the tests
- Do test

## Assumptions

- The entry point and the exit are always the same, letter B

## To Run

## To Test

## Future improvements

All the files use the maze file to work. In the future, you can decouple use Dependency Inyection.
