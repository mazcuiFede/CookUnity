## I assume
It's important to talk with the owner to make sure that you understand the requirements, but in this case I will assume some items using my common sense:

- The entry point is in the first row of the maze.
- The exit is in the last column of the maze.
- You can only move horizontally and vertically. Not diagonally.

## Algorithm

I will be use the "right hand algorithm", for further information https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/06/opinion/l-why-right-hand-rule-for-mazes-works-075389.html#:~:text=If%20upon%20entering%20a%20maze,will%20be%20found%20without%20fail.
